# Timetable Generator

A timetable generator application that helps you keep track of your schedule.

## Getting Started

1. Run Timetable Generator.exe in the exe folder.
2. Click on the "Parse Timetable" button and select your desired timetable .xlsx file. Wait for the app to give you a pop-up declaring that the app has been updated according to the provided timetable.
3. Select your courses and sections alongside them (no need to select labs, they will be auto-selected).
4. Click on submit, which will generate an HTML timetable.

## Note
This app is in alpha phase and still incredibly early in development. If you spot any bugs, please report them in the Github issues section.
